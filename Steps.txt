1. Started reading methods on robot navigation and detection of free space.
2. Estimate the hough transofrms or cany edge lines that divide the floor from the walls of the truck.

I'm facing issues for python, numpy, tensorflow version incompatibility etc. I've resolved them.
This network can be fine tuned further for truck segmentation.

Other tend to use Depth information either by using RGB-D camera of two shifted images simultaneously to use stereo to get the depth cues.
Hence for using a single 2d image we can use traditional hough transformation and canny edges to decide the lines and find the corners as well.
Or use already trained deep learning methods for 2d image indoor segmentation.

The lines denoting the lane will tend to extend from the foreground of an image into the background along paths that are angled slightly inwards


PipeLine:
1. Center the image so that ceiling and floor parts are equally visible for the reference.
2. Can either use hand engineered features like canny edge and hough lines. 
3. Or use segmentation models for indoor segmentation (MIT Dataset : http://sceneparsing.csail.mit.edu/). (classes are : ceiling, walls, floor) and get the percentage of vacant ceiling be finding ration of floor pixels w.r.t ceiling pixels. This network can be further tuned with the segmentations of truck.
